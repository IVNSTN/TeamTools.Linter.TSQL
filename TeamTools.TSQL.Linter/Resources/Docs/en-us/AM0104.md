| Mnemo | EXEC_PROC_SCHEMA
| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [Ambiguity](./Category_Ambiguity.md)
| Source code | [SchemaQualifiedProcCallRule.cs](../../../Rules/Ambiguity/SchemaQualifiedProcCallRule.cs)

## Cause

<p id="descr">This rule is triggered when the schema name is skipped in the stored procedure call.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
EXEC uspGetWhereUsedProductID 819;
```

Good

```sql
-- user defined stored procedures
EXEC dbo.uspGetWhereUsedProductID 819;
-- system stored procedures
EXEC sp_help;
EXEC sp_who;
```

## Tips

💡 Rule is not triggered when calling a system stored procedure.

💡 Different users may have different DEFAULT_SCHEMA, except members of the sysadmin. You should always specify schema in the stored procedure call, because the schema should not depend on the user who will run the script.
