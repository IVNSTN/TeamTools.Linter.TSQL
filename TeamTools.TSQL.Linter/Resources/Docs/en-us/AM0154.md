| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [Ambiguity](./Category_Ambiguity.md)
| Source code | [OrderByDirectionAmbiguityRule.cs](../../../Rules/Ambiguity/OrderByDirectionAmbiguityRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if there is at least one expression with DESC and at least one expression without direction in the ORDER BY clause.
<p id="descr">Define the ordering direction explicitly.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql

SELECT name, hired_at, fired_at FROM dbo.hiredate_view ORDER BY hired_at, fired_at DESC
```

Good

```sql
SELECT name, hired_at, fired_at FROM dbo.hiredate_view ORDER BY hired_at ASC, fired_at DESC
```

## Tips

💡 You should not mislead the code reader. The direction is not obvious to the code reader when not specified. It may be perceived as DESC for all expressions in the ORDER BY clause.
