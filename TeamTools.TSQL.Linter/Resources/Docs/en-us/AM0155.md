| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [Ambiguity](./Category_Ambiguity.md), [Indices](./Group_Indices.md)
| Source code | [IndexSortDirectionAmbiguityRule.cs](../../../Rules/Ambiguity/IndexSortDirectionAmbiguityRule.cs)

## Cause

<p id="descr">This rule is triggered if there is at least one column with DESC and at least one column without sorting direction in the index column list.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX ix_dbo_log_id_log_level ON dbo.log (id, log_level DESC);
```

Good

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX ix_dbo_log_id_log_level ON dbo.log (id ASC, log_level DESC);
```

## Tips

💡 You should not mislead the code reader. The sorting direction is not obvious to the code reader when not specified. It may be perceived as DESC for all columns in the index column list.
