| Mnemo | INSERT_COLUMN_ALIAS_MATCH_TARGET
| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [Ambiguity](./Category_Ambiguity.md)
| Source code | [InsertedColumnAliasMatchTargetRule.cs](../../../Rules/Ambiguity/InsertedColumnAliasMatchTargetRule.cs)

## Cause

<p id="descr">This rule is triggered when there is a difference between target and source column name.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
INSERT INTO dbo.employee (person_id, person_name, is_remote)
SELECT
    PN.id
    , PN.full_name
    , IIF(PN.planet = 'Earth', 0, 1) AS is_alien
FROM dbo.person AS PN;
```

Good

```sql
INSERT INTO dbo.employee (person_id, person_name, is_remote)
SELECT
    PN.id as person_id
    , PN.full_name as person_name
    , IIF(PN.planet = 'Earth', 0, 1) AS is_remote
FROM dbo.person AS PN;
```

## Tips

💡 Use aliases to bring the names of columns from select to names in the target for INSERT-SELECT statements, which will confirm that they are correct.
