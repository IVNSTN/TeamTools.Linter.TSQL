| Mnemo | NONUNIQUE_TABLE_ALIAS
| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [Ambiguity](./Category_Ambiguity.md)
| Source code | [UniqueTableAliasRule.cs](../../../Rules/Ambiguity/UniqueTableAliasRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if the query contains duplicate table aliases or subqueries.
<p id="descr">Assign unique aliases.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
SELECT
    col_a
FROM foo AS t
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM bar AS t WHERE t.id = id)
```

Good

```sql
SELECT
    col_a
FROM foo
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM bar AS br WHERE br.id = foo.id)
```

## Tips

💡 In a query with multiple tables and subqueries, table aliases may accidentally be repeated. The Database Engine will select something as a source in ambiguous situations and execute the query, however it is not guarantied that this choice will be exactly what the author of the code had in mind.

💡 Create unique aliases for overlapping contexts.
