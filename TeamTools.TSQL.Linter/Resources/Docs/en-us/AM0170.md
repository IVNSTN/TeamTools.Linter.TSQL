| Source code | [TableAliasMimicksOtherTableRule.cs](../../../Rules/Ambiguity/TableAliasMimicksOtherTableRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if the alias given to a table or subquery in the query matches the name of another table used.
<p id="descr">Assign unique alias that do not conflict with object names.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
SELECT old.id AS name, new.name AS id
FROM dbo.tbl AS t
INNER JOIN t AS old
    ON 1=1
INNER JOIN old AS new
    ON 1=1
```

Good

```sql
SELECT old.id AS name, new.name AS id
FROM dbo.tbl AS t
INNER JOIN #new AS old
    ON 1=1
INNER JOIN #old AS new
    ON 1=1
```

## Tips

💡 Choose aliases thoughtfully. Even if you need to reverse meaning

```sql
FROM new as old
JOIN old as new
```

try to choose aliases that do not overlap with object names.
