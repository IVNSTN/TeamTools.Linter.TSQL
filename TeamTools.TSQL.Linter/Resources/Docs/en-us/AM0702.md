| Source code | [AmbiguousUniquenessRule.cs](../../../Rules/Ambiguity/AmbiguousUniquenessRule.cs)

## Cause

<p id="descr">This rule is triggered if columns on which a unique index has already been created are included in a broader unique index.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
DECLARE @t TABLE
(
    id      INT PRIMARY KEY
    , title VARCHAR(30)
    , dt    DATETIME
    , UNIQUE (title)
    , UNIQUE (title, id, dt)
);
```

Good

```sql
DECLARE @t TABLE
(
    id    INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(30),
    dt    DATETIME,
    UNIQUE (title),
    UNIQUE(dt)
)
```

## Tips

💡 Multiple unique indexes may be created to address performance issues. However, inclusion of a  combination of columns already known as unique, should raise concerns and be worth paying attention to.
