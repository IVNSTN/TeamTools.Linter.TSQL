## Cause

This rule is triggered if a negation of a compound predicate is detected without an explicit definition of the scope of the negation.
<p id="descr">Use parentheses to define the scope of the negation.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
IF NOT @a = 0 AND @a > b
    PRINT '1'
```

Good

```sql
IF (NOT @a IS NULL) AND @a > b
    PRINT '1'
```

## Tips

💡 The negation of a complex expression can be perceived ambiguously: one will read it as a negation of the first expression, another - as a negation of the entire combination of predicate expressions. It is better to add a pair of brackets and make the code more unambiguous.

💡 Does not applied to predicates in which all compound fragments have their own negations: `NOT <expr> AND NOT <expr> OR NOT <expr>...`
