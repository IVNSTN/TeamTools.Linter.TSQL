| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [Ambiguity](./Category_Ambiguity.md)
| Source code | [AmbiguousColumnBelongingRule.cs](../../../Rules/Ambiguity/AmbiguousColumnBelongingRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if the column does not have an alias of the source table.
<p id="descr">Add a source table alias.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
UPDATE t SET
    title = b.new_title
OUTPUT t.title
FROM dbo.foo AS t
INNER JOIN dbo.bar AS b
    ON t.id = parent_id
WHERE title LIKE 'asdf%'
GO
```

Good

```sql
UPDATE t SET
    title = b.new_title,
FROM dbo.foo AS t
INNER JOIN dbo.bar AS b
    ON t.id = b.parent_id
WHERE t.title LIKE 'asdf%';
```

## Tips

💡 Assign aliases to all tables, set aliases for all referenced columns.

💡 Even if a query is written for one table, it is still better to give it an alias and set this alias for all columns. If you do not do this, you will get "football" in the direction of the next developer who will have to add a join to this query. Then, instead of adding this one join, he will have to first refactor the entire old query. This is not the most constructive scenario.
