## Cause

<p id="descr">This rule is triggered when there are multiple attempts to assign a variable value in one expression.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
EXEC @res = dbo.test
    @param = @res OUTPUT

FETCH NEXT FROM @cursor
INTO @a, @a
```

Good

```sql
EXEC @res_code = dbo.test
    @param = @res OUTPUT

FETCH NEXT FROM @cursor
INTO @a, @b
```

## Tips

💡 Multiple attempts to assign a value to a variable within a single expression introduce ambiguity. Rewrite the expression so that each variable is assigned a new value only once.
