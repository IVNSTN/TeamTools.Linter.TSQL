## Cause

This rule is triggered if the grantor for schemas or types is specified.
<p id="descr">Remove the grantor.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
GRANT REFERENCES ON type::acme.far
TO asdf
AS admin;
```

Good

```sql
GRANT REFERENCES ON type::acme.far
TO asdf
```

## Tips

💡 DacFx considers it superfluous to specify the grantor in grants for schemas and user types, because of this they fall into the "eternal diff" and are constantly being reissued.
