# Constraint uses 'IN' for list of values

| Severity | ⚠ Warning

| Source code | [ConstraintWithoutListsRule.cs](../../../Rules/ContinuousDeployment/ConstraintWithoutListsRule.cs)

## Cause

Triggered if IN is used in the constraint with an enumeration of acceptable values. The constraints of temporary tables and variable tables are ignored.
<p id="descr">Change IN to an enumeration of values via OR.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE TABLE a
(
    b     INT     NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
    , c   CHAR(1) NULL     DEFAULT 'd'
    , bar INT NOT NULL    
    , CONSTRAINT cs CHECK (bar IN (2, 3))
    , CONSTRAINT PK_a PRIMARY KEY (b)
);
GO
```

Good

```sql
CREATE TABLE a
(
    b     INT     NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
    , c   CHAR(1) NULL     DEFAULT 'd'
    , bar INT NOT NULL    
    , CONSTRAINT cs CHECK (bar = 2 OR bar = 3)
    , CONSTRAINT PK_a PRIMARY KEY (b)
);
GO
```

## Tips

💡 In CHECK constants, it is convenient to specify IN with an enumeration of acceptable values and this is the valid construction, however, DacFx does not know how to match IN in the project with IN on the server and such constants fall into the "eternal diff", for every deployment, although nothing changes. Does not react on temp tables and table variables.
