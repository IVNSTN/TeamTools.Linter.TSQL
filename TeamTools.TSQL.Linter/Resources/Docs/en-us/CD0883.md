| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [ContinuousDelivery](./Category_ContinuousDelivery.md)
| Source code | [PartitionFunctionRangeValuesRule.cs](../../../Rules/ContinuousDeployment/PartitionFunctionRangeValuesRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if all possible sections are listed in the definition of the partitioning function.
<p id="descr">Replace the section list with a single dummy value.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE PARTITION FUNCTION DateRanges (DATETIME2(7))
    AS RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
(
    '01/02/2000 00:00:00'
    , '01/03/2000 00:00:00'
    , '01/04/2000 00:00:00'
    , '01/05/2000 00:00:00'
    , '01/06/2000 00:00:00'
    , '01/07/2000 00:00:00'
    , '01/08/2000 00:00:00'
    , '01/09/2000 00:00:00'
    , '01/10/2000 00:00:00'
);
GO
```

Good

```sql
CREATE PARTITION FUNCTION DateRanges (DATETIME2(7))
    AS RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES ('01/02/2000 00:00:00');
GO
```

## Tips

💡 Listing all possible values in the definition of the partitioning function is not the developer's task. The sections are maintained by DBAs. In the source code, an excessively long list of values is not needed, it does not affect anything and only hinders and misleads. In order for the project to compile and deploy correctly, all you need to do is add the header of the partitioning function itself to the project with a single dummy value.

💡 There is also a similar rule [HD0916](./HD0916.md). The difference is that this rule responds to the function definition script, while HD0916 responds to the places where the function is referenced, listing all possible sections.
