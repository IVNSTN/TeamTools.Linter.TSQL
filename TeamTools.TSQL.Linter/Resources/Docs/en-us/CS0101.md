|||
|-|-|
| Id | **CS0101**
| Mnemo | SELECT_INTO
| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [CodeSmell](./Category_CodeSmell.md)
| Source code | [SelectIntoRule.cs](../../../Rules/CodeSmell/SelectIntoRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if the `SELECT`-`INTO` expression is found.
<p id="descr">Create a table and populate it with INSERT-SELECT.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
SELECT a
INTO #bar
FROM dbo.foo;
```

Good

```sql
CREATE TABLE #bar (a VARCHAR(255));

INSERT INTO #bar
SELECT a
FROM dbo.foo;
```

## Tips

💡 `SELECT * INTO` is the maximum level of laziness of the previous developer and does not mean that all the fields of the original table are really needed. When reworking, you need to analyze the code that uses the collected data, it may be that only a few columns are really needed.
