# GOTO and labels are forbidden

| Id | **CS0105**
| Mnemo | GOTO
| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [CodeSmell](./Category_CodeSmell.md)
| Source code | [GoToRule.cs](../../../Rules/CodeSmell/GoToRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if a use of the `GOTO` command or a label (`LABEL`) is detected.
<p id="descr">Rewrite the code without using GOTO.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
SELECT 1
GOTO asfd
asdf:
```

## Tips

💡 Old modules make extensive use of the `GOTO` construct, creating complex and not always obvious code that requires careful analysis. In some cases, especially with branched and critical code blocks, massive changing such structures can be risky. Therefore, it is recommended to whitelist such modules after consultation with responsible persons. In the long term, it is advisable to gradually get rid of the use of `GOTO` in all modules.
