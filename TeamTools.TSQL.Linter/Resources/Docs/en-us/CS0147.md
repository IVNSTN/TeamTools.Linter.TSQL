## Cause

This rule is triggered if `SYSNAME` is detected to specify the table column type.
<p id="descr">Use a string type with an explicit size specification.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE TABLE foo (name SYSNAME);
```

Good

```sql
CREATE TABLE foo (name NVARCHAR(128) NOT NULL);
```

## Tips

💡 The `SYSNAME` datatype is a system-provided user-defined data type that is functionally equivalent to the `NVARCHAR(128)` type, except that it does not allow `NULL` values.

💡 The `SYSNAME` datatype appears where some magic is expected from it. Usually, this ends with the code being written without understanding what length and what bit depth of the strings are actually used. Some expect that `SYSNAME` will always fit into a one-bit string of 50 characters, others sincerely believe that `SYSNAME` is for the object name, which means that putting a four-part object name into one `SYSNAME` is quite correct and reasonable.
