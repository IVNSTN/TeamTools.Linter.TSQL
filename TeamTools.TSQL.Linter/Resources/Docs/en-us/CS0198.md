# Trigger cyclical execution

|||
|-|-|
| Id | **CS0198**
| Mnemo | TRIGGER_CIRCULAR_ACTION
| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [CodeSmell](./Category_CodeSmell.md)
| Source code | [TriggerCircularActionRule.cs](../../../Rules/CodeSmell/TriggerCircularActionRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered when AFTER trigger includes action that causes trigger cyclical execution.
<p id="descr">Remove the operator that causes trigger cyclical execution.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER dbo.trg ON dbo.foo
AFTER INSERT, UPDATE
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT dbo.foo(title)
    VALUES ('asdf')
END
```

Good

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER dbo.trg ON dbo.foo
AFTER INSERT, UPDATE
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT dbo.table(title)
    VALUES ('asdf')
END
```

## Tips

💡 The rule checks:

- UPDATE in AFTER UPDATE
- INSERT in AFTER INSERT
- DELETE in AFTER DELETE

💡 The rule doesn't work for INSTEAD OF triggers because they aren't cyclical.
