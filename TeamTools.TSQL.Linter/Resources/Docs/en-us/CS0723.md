## Cause

The rule is triggered if for a common table expression or subquery, the external list of columns contains columns with the same names as in the query body, but arranged in a different order.
<p id="descr">Check the column names and order.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
SELECT Id, CodeMarket
FROM
(
  SELECT TOP 10 IdMarket, CodeMarket
  FROM dbo.Markets
) AS T(CodeMarket, Id);
```

Good

```sql
SELECT Id, CodeMarket
FROM
(
  SELECT TOP 10 IdMarket, CodeMarket
  FROM dbo.Markets
) AS T(Id, CodeMarket);
```

## Tips

💡 Subqueries and common table expressions allow external specification of the list of columns that should be returned.
