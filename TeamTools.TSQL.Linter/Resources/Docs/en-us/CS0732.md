| Severity | ⚠ Warning

| Source code | [GoAfterProcRule.cs](../../../Rules/CodeSmell/GoAfterProcRule.cs)

## Cause

The rule is triggered if the code of a stored procedure or other object in the script is not terminated with GO command.
<p id="descr">Add the GO command to the end of the script.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.my_proc
AS
BEGIN
...
END;
```

Good

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.my_proc
AS
BEGIN
...
END;
GO
```

## Tips

💡 The code of a stored procedure or other object in a script must be completed with the "GO" command. Otherwise, all subsequent code unrelated to this object will be treated as part of its code.

💡 The GO command in MS SQL informs SQL Server programs about the end of the Transact-SQL instruction package. It sends a signal to tools such as SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or sqlcmd that the current set of T-SQL statements is ready to be sent to the server.
