## Cause

This rule is triggered if the numeric type is explicitly converted to `NVARCHAR` or `NCHAR`.
<p id="descr">Remove the explicit unicode conversion.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
SELECT CAST(100 AS NCHAR(10));       --  1

DECLARE @i INT = -1;

PRINT CONVERT(NVARCHAR(10), @i);     -- 2
```

Good

```sql
DECLARE @i INT = -1;

SELECT CAST(@i AS VARCHAR(10));
```

## Tips

💡 Often, numbers in a long unicode string expression are added to a unicode string, and `NVARCHAR`/`NCHAR` are used rather for uniformity.  In such cases, there is no need to correct anything. In other cases, it is worth checking the author's intention. Maybe unicode should appear, but some logic has been lost and only an orphaned number conversion remains.
