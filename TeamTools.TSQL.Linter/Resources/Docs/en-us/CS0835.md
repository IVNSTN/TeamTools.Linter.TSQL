<p id="descr">Rewrite using characters of only one alphabet.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
-- сomment contents аre supposed to be handled by this rule (cyrillic 'с' and 'а' here)
/*
    coМment contents are supposed to be handled by Тhis rule
    (cyrillic 'М' and 'Т' in the line above)
*/
```

Good

```sql
-- good comment

/* ничего 123 интересного */
```
