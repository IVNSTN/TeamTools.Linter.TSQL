| Severity | ⚠ Warning

| Source code | [IntersectExceptOnLiteralRule.cs](../../../Rules/CodeSmell/IntersectExceptOnLiteralRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered when ResultSet in INTERSECT or EXCEPT construction includes different literals.
<p id="descr">Fix literals in ResultSet.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
SELECT 1 AS id, foo.a, NULL AS name FROM dbo.foo
INTERSECT
SELECT 1 AS id, bar.a, 't' AS name FROM dbo.bar
EXCEPT
SELECT 0, zar.a, 'z' FROM dbo.zar;
```

Good

```sql
SELECT 0 AS id, foo.a, 't' AS name FROM dbo.foo
INTERSECT
SELECT 0 AS id, bar.a, 't' AS name FROM dbo.bar
EXCEPT
SELECT 0, zar.a, 't' FROM dbo.zar;
```

## Tips

💡 ResultSet includes different literals is redundant or broken.
