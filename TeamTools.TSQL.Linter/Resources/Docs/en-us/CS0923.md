| Mnemo | SORTED_INSERT
| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [CodeSmell](./Category_CodeSmell.md)
| Source code | [InsertWithOrderByRule.cs](../../../Rules/CodeSmell/InsertWithOrderByRule.cs)

## Cause

The rule is triggered if the sort order of the rows to be inserted is specified.
<p id="descr">Remove the sorting of the rowset.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
INSERT INTO dbo.table1(id, name)
SELECT id, name
FROM dbo.table2
ORDER BY id;
```

Good

```sql
INSERT INTO dbo.table1(id, name)
SELECT id, name
FROM dbo.table2;
```

## Tips

💡 Sorting a set of rows using the ORDER BY clause does not guarantee that the rows will be inserted in a specific order.

💡 To populate the "prepared" temporary tables, it is more reliable to use `ROW_NUMBER`.
