The rule is triggered if important comments are used in the code.
<p id="descr">Pay attention to the important comments in the code.</p>

## Examples

Good

```sql
...
ELSE
/* TODO : why in other places is it func. without CASE? */
   dbo.f_money(@id)
END
...
```

## Tips

💡 TODO - Some improvements have been postponed for later, perhaps now is the time to complete it.

💡 FIXME - A problem has been found in the code, which can be either serious or not so serious. Perhaps now there is an opportunity or time to fix it.

💡 HACK - In this case, a temporary method was used, which should be rewritten into a clear and permanent one.

💡 REMOVEONRELEASE - Temporary code for debugging the main code, it probably needs to be removed.
