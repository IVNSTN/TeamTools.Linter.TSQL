| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [CodeSmell](./Category_CodeSmell.md)
| Source code | [VariableNotAssignedBeforeUsageRule.cs](../../../Rules/CodeSmell/VariableNotAssignedBeforeUsageRule.cs)

## Cause

The rule is triggered if a variable is referenced before it has been assigned a value.
<p id="descr">Assign a value to the variable.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
DECLARE @Id INT
SET @Id = @Id * 2
```

Good

```sql
DECLARE @Id INT = 5
SET @Id = @Id * 2
```

## Tips

💡 False positives are possible in loops where the value of a variable from the previous iteration is used for analysis.

💡 If the initial value of NULL is set for a variable in the DECLARE statement, this does not mean that it must be filled in. Even if you don't explicitly assign any value to it, it will still store NULL.
