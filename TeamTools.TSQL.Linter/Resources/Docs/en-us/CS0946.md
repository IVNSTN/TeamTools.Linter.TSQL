# Literal size is too big

|||
|-|-|
| Id | **CS0946**
| Mnemo | LITERAL_OVERSIZE
| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [CodeSmell](./Category_CodeSmell.md)
| Source code | [LiteralOversizeRule.cs](../../../Rules/CodeSmell/LiteralOversizeRule.cs)

## Cause

The rule is triggered if a variable is assigned a string that is too large to store.
<p id="descr">Determine the appropriate size of the variable.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
DECLARE @var CHAR(1);
SELECT ISNULL(@var, '"NULL"');
```

Good

```sql
DECLARE @var CHAR(1);
SELECT ISNULL(CAST(@var AS CHAR(6)), '"NULL"');
```

## Tips

💡 If the variable type is set to VARCHAR or CHAR without specifying a length, then VARCHAR will have a length of 30 and CHAR will have a single character.

💡 The [CS0111](./CS0111.md) rule controls that the dimension must be specified.

💡 The ISNULL function truncates the second parameter to the size of the first one. The type and dimension of the ISNULL result are always equal to those of the first parameter. In the example above, '"' will be returned, not '"NULL"' as expected.
