| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [CodeSmell](./Category_CodeSmell.md)
| Source code | [InfiniteLoopHasNoBreakRule.cs](../../../Rules/CodeSmell/InfiniteLoopHasNoBreakRule.cs)

## Cause

The rule is triggered if a WHILE loop is declared infinite, but there is no condition to terminate the loop in its body.
<p id="descr">Define the condition for completing the loop.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
WHILE(1=1)
BEGIN
...
    FROM my_table AS T
    WHERE T.Id > @Id;
END
```

Good

```sql
WHILE(1=1)
BEGIN
...
    FROM my_table AS T
    WHERE T.Id > @Id;

IF @@ROWCOUNT = 0
    BREAK;
...
END
```

## Tips

💡 Commands to terminate the cycle: **BREAK**, **RETURN**, **THROW**.
