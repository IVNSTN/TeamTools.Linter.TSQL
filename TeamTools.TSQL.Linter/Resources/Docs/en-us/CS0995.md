## Cause

This rule is triggered when accurate type is mixing with FLOAT or REAL.
<p id="descr">Use FLOAT or REAL types with great care.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
DECLARE
    @i REAL
    , @n DECIMAL(10, 2);

SELECT @i + @n;
```

Good

```sql
DECLARE
    @i INT
    , @n DECIMAL(10, 2);

SELECT @i + @n;
```

## Tips

💡 The `FLOAT` type has priority over than any other numeric type. Without explicit conversion of `FLOAT`, the result of any numeric expression with `FLOAT` type is `FLOAT`.

💡 Even if a variable of the `FLOAT` type does not contain a value, its participation in the formula still leads to a loss of accuracy.
