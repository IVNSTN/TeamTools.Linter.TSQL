## Cause

This rule is triggered when in MERGE the alias 'trg' isn't used for the target table or the alias 'src' isn't used for the source table.
<p id="descr">Correct alias names.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
MERGE dbo.foo AS dest
USING (SELECT a, b, c FROM dbo.bar AS br) AS source
ON dest.id = source.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    DELETE;
```

Good

```sql
MERGE dbo.foo AS trg
USING (SELECT a, b, c FROM dbo.bar AS br) AS src
ON trg.id = src.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    DELETE;
```
