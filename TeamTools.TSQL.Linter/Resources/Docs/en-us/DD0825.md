## Tips

💡 A table consisting of a single column is a very controversial database design pattern. This can occur in table variables and table types, and even then, in some cases, additional details would not hurt. For persistent tables, this is completely unusual. In most situations, even when storing a single natural value, you will need: a surrogate key, an insertion date, possibly the date of the last modification, or similar temporal fields, the on/off attribute, or ROWVERSION. Without these fields, working with a table becomes quite difficult.
