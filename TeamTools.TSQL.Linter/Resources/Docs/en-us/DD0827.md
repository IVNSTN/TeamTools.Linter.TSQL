## Cause

This rule is triggered if the calculated column is defined by the literal (its value does not change under any circumstances).
<p id= "descr">Replace the constant with an expression or delete the column.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.foo
(
    num     DECIMAL NOT NULL
    , calc  AS 1
);
```

Good

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.foo
(
    num     DECIMAL NOT NULL
    , calc  AS num + 1
);
```

## Tips

💡 You may need the column as an intermediate step, for clarity, or to ensure backwards compatibility, but in general it looks suspicious. Probably, the column is not necessary and can be deleted.
