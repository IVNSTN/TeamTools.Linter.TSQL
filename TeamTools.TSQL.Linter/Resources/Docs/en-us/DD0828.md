## Cause

This rule is triggered if the calculated column mirrors the value of another column (acts as a synonym).
<p id= "descr">Replace the name of the repeated column with an expression or delete this column.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.foo
(
    num     DECIMAL NOT NULL
    , calc  AS num
);
```

Good

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.foo
(
    num     DECIMAL NOT NULL
    , calc  AS num + 1
);
```

## Tips

💡 Such a column is sometimes useful for clarity or backwards compatibility, but it generally looks suspicious. Probably, the column is not necessary and can be deleted.
