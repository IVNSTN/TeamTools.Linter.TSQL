| Id | **DM0513**
| Mnemo | STATISTICS_MANAGEMENT
| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [DatabaseMaintenance](./Category_DatabaseMaintenance.md)
| Source code | [StatisticsManagementRule.cs](../../../Rules/DatabaseMaintenance/StatisticsManagementRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if a DDL statement for statistics management is found.
<p id="descr">Remove DDL for statistics management.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE STATISTICS asdf ON dbo.foo(bar);

DROP STATISTICS stat.dbo.foo;
```

## Tips

💡 Maintaining statistics is responsibility of operations, not development.

💡 Utility and administrative stored procedures should be organized within dedicated schemas and databases.

💡 Having such a code is dangerous, because an ordinary user of the product, by gaining access to some interface stored procedure, can directly or indirectly gain access to the DBMS management. Only the DBA should have such access.
