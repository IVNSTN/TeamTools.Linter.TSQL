| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [DatabaseMaintenance](./Category_DatabaseMaintenance.md)
| Source code | [TableDropRule.cs](../../../Rules/DatabaseMaintenance/TableDropRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if a DROP TABLE statement for a persistent table is found.
<p id="descr">Remove DROP TABLE or use a temporary object.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
DROP TABLE dbo.main_data
```

Good

```sql
DROP TABLE #main_data
```

## Tips

💡 Dropping of temporary tables (#) is allowed.

💡 Utility and administrative stored procedures should be organized within dedicated schemas and databases.

💡 Having such a code is dangerous, because an ordinary user of the product, by gaining access to some interface stored procedure, can directly or indirectly gain access to the DBMS management. Only the DBA should have such access.
