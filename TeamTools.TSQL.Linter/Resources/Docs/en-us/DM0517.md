| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [DatabaseMaintenance](./Category_DatabaseMaintenance.md)
| Source code | [TablePartitionSwitchRule.cs](../../../Rules/DatabaseMaintenance/TablePartitionSwitchRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if a SWITCH PARTITION command is found.
<p id="descr">Remove the code that controls table partitions.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
ALTER TABLE dbo.bar SWITCH PARTITION 1 TO dbo.bar_archive
```

## Tips

💡 Utility and administrative stored procedures should be organized within dedicated schemas and databases.

💡 Having such a code is dangerous, because an ordinary user of the product, by gaining access to some interface stored procedure, can directly or indirectly gain access to the DBMS management. Only the DBA should have such access.
