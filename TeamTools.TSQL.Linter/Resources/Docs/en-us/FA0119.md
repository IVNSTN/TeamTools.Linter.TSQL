| Id | **FA0119**
| Mnemo | RETURN_VALUE_ILLEGAL
| Severity | ⛔ Error
| Category | [Failure](./Category_Failure.md)
| Source code | [ReturnValueIllegalRule.cs](../../../Rules/Failure/ReturnValueIllegalRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if the code uses `RETURN` with a value, but this is unacceptable for the type of objects being created (trigger or table-valued function).
<p id="descr">Delete RETURN value.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER dbo.bar
ON dbo.zar
AFTER DELETE
AS
BEGIN
    RETURN 1;
END;
```

Good

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER dbo.bar
ON dbo.zar
AFTER DELETE
AS
BEGIN
    RETURN;
END;
```
