| Source code | [MultilineCommentClosingTagAlignRule.cs](../../../Rules/Formatting/MultilineCommentClosingTagAlignRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if the opening and closing tags of a multiline comment are not on the same line as the text and have different indentations.
<p id="descr">Align the indentation of the open-close tags of the multiline comment.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
/*
This is a
multiline comment
    */

/* This is a
multiline comment
*/
```

Good

```sql
/*
This is a
multiline comment
*/

/* This is a
multiline comment */
```

## Tips

💡 Two formatting options are allowed:

```sql
/*
"BLOCK": where opening and closing are formatted
as BEGIN-END on a separate line and should have the same indentation
*/
```

or

```sql
/* "BRICK": the opening and
closing tags of the comment are located
on lines with text; they cannot be aligned equally */
```
