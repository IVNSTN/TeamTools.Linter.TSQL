| Mnemo | OPEN_CLOSE_PARENTHESIS_ALIGNED
| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [Formatting](./Category_Formatting.md)
| Source code | [OpenCloseParenthesisAlignRule.cs](../../../Rules/Formatting/OpenCloseParenthesisAlignRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if opening and closing parentheses are placed on separate lines and have different indentations.
<p id="descr">Align the opening and closing parentheses.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
SELECT Id FROM (
    SELECT Id FROM SomeTable
) AS tbl;
```

Good

```sql
SELECT Id FROM
(
    SELECT Id FROM SomeTable
) AS tbl;
```

## Tips

💡 If the parentheses are on the lines containing code then the rule does not apply. Example:

```sql
IIF(asdf=asdf,
    asdf, adsf * asdf / adsf) -- OK.
```
