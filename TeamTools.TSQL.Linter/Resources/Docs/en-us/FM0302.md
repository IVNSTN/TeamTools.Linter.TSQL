## Cause

This rule is triggered if an indentation contains both tabs and spaces.
<p id="descr">Use spaces.</p>

## Examples

Bad
<!-- markdownlint-disable no-hard-tabs -->
```sql
 	 -- There are tabs and spaces in the indentation
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable no-hard-tabs -->

Good

```sql
    -- There are spaces only in the indentation
```

## Tips

💡 The comments content should be changed manually because **SqlPrompt** formatter doesn't support this. You can use a replace by regex option in VS, SSMS, Notepad++: tab symbol relates to **\t** which should be replaced with four spaces.

💡 The correctly configured **FormatOnSave** extension helps with tabs in comments.

💡 Be careful: reinstalling IDE or moving to another PC can reset the settings.
