# Code flow based on HOST_NAME

| Mnemo | HOST_NAME_BASED_FLOW
| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [Hardcode](./Category_Hardcode.md)
| Source code | [HostNameBasedCodeFlowRule.cs](../../../Rules/Hardcode/HostNameBasedCodeFlowRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if host-based code flow is detected.
<p id="descr">Remove HOST_NAME() in the IF or WHERE predicate.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
UPDATE t SET
    foo = bar
FROM tbl AS t
WHERE 'asdf' <> HOST_NAME()
```

Good

```sql
UPDATE t SET
    caller = HOST_NAME()
FROM tbl AS t
WHERE caller IS NULL
```

## Tips

💡Most mentions of this feature originate from the desire to debug the code by a specific employee, and this has no right to exist in production.

💡Only triggered if HOST_NAME() detected in IF or WHERE predicates. If you just need to log the name of the calling host - no problems.
