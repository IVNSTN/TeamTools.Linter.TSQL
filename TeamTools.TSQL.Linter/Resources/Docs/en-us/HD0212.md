## Cause

This rule is triggered when an constant is used as database or server name in the synonym definition script.
<p id="descr">Replace constant in the database/server name with variable</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE SYNONYM foo FOR server.db.dbo.bar;

CREATE SYNONYM foo FOR [$(server_var)].db.dbo.bar;

CREATE SYNONYM foo FOR server.[$(db_var)].dbo.bar;
```

Good

```sql
CREATE SYNONYM foo FOR [$(server_var)].[$(db_var)].dbo.bar;
```

## Tips

💡Synonyms should use variables [$(reference_var)], rather than names of databases and servers.

💡To define such a variable in the project, you need to add the corresponding dacpac to the project dependencies. It is important not to forget to update the publish.xml and perform same actions in the project with tests, if there is one.
