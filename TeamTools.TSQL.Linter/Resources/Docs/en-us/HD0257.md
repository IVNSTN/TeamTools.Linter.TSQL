| Mnemo | PERSONAL_DATA_EMAIL
| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [Hardcode](./Category_Hardcode.md)
| Source code | [PersonalDataEmailRule.cs](../../../Rules/Hardcode/PersonalDataEmailRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if hardcoded email address is found in the code.
<p id="descr">Remove hardcoded email address.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
-- hello@world.org

SELECT 'adsf@asdf.ru' AS email;
```

Good

```sql
--@var_commented

SELECT 'adsf 926 @ asdf - .ru' AS email;
```

## Tips

💡Internal mailings should be issued via serv.subscription and mnemonic codes. External ones should be in SSSRS and other similar services.

💡Commented lines like *@adsf may look like mail - to prevent the rule from triggering, just put spaces around the operators.
