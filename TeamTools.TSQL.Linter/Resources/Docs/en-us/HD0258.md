| Mnemo | PERSONAL_DATA_PHONE
| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [Hardcode](./Category_Hardcode.md)
| Source code | [PersonalDataPhoneRule.cs](../../../Rules/Hardcode/PersonalDataPhoneRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if a hardcoded phone number is found in the code.
<p id="descr">Remove the hardcoded phone number.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
-- +9(999)999-999-99

SELECT '+7(123)123-234-45' AS phone
```

Good

```sql
-- 9999999999

SELECT '495 adsf 926 --- 00011' AS phone
```

## Tips

💡Internal messaging should be designed through admin_role_members and mnemonic codes. External ones should use SSRS and other similar services.

💡Commented lines with long numeric identifiers may look like phones - to stop the rule from triggering, try choosing an identifier that is less phone-like.
