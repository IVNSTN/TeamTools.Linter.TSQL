| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [Hardcode](./Category_Hardcode.md)
| Source code | [PartitionSchemeFileGroupsHardcodedRule.cs](../../../Rules/Hardcode/PartitionSchemeFileGroupsHardcodedRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if an explicit filegroup enumeration is found in the partition scheme definition.
<p id="descr">Replace the filegroup enumeration with ALL TO ([PRIMARY])</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE PARTITION SCHEME [ps_ord_no]
AS PARTITION [pf_ord_no]
TO ([ARCHIVE])

CREATE PARTITION SCHEME [ps_ord_no]
AS PARTITION [pf_ord_no]
TO ([PRIMARY], [PRIMARY])
```

Good

```sql
CREATE PARTITION SCHEME [ps_ord_no]
AS PARTITION [pf_ord_no]
ALL TO ([PRIMARY])
```

## Tips

💡File groups are the operational area, the area of ​​responsibility of the DBA. There is no need to "program" them.

💡For the description of the partition schema in the project, it is enough to specify it as

```sql
ALL TO ([PRIMARY])
```
