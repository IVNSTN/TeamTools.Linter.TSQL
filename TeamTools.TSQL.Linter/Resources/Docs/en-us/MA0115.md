## Cause

<p id="descr">This rule is triggered if no sorting is specified in the cursor definition.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
DECLARE cr CURSOR GLOBAL FORWARD_ONLY STATIC FOR
    SELECT a, b, (SELECT TOP (1) z FROM bar) AS t FROM foo;
```

Good
```sql
DECLARE cr CURSOR LOCAL FORWARD_ONLY STATIC FOR
    SELECT a, b, (SELECT TOP (1) z FROM bar) AS t FROM foo ORDER BY b DESC;
```

## Tips

💡 Sorting is needed to predict the order of the incoming set processing and also helps with debugging and monitoring.
