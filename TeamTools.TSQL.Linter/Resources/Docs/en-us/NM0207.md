| Source code | [TableAliasLengthRule.cs](../../../Rules/Naming/TableAliasLengthRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if a single-symbol table alias is found in the code.
<p id="descr">Use more than one symbol for table alias.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbo.test AS t
```

Good

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbo.test AS tst
```

## Tips

💡 For system tables (INSERTED, DELETED) you can use i and d aliases respectively.

💡 The rule ignores FOR XML AUTO construction, because aliases create document structure.
