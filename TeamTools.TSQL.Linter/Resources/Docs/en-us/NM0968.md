| Mnemo | FIELD_NAME_CAMEL_CASE
| Severity | ℹ Hint
| Category | [Naming](./Category_Naming.md)
| Source code | [FieldNameCamelCaseRule.cs](../../../Rules/Naming/FieldNameCamelCaseRule.cs)

## Cause
The rule is triggered if the project settings specify
that the columns name must match the camelCase notation,
but it does not match.

<p id="descr">Use camelCase notation.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.reg_customers (id BIGINT, name NVARCHAR(50), city_id INT);
```

Good

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.reg_customers (id BIGINT, name NVARCHAR(50), cityId INT);
```

## Tips

💡 The rule also applies to columns of views, table_functions, procedures, temporary tables # and table variables @

💡 Requires such notation only in projects where it is explicitly specified in the settings.

The rule is mutually exclisive with rules [NM0966](./NM0966.md), [NM0967](./NM0967.md)
