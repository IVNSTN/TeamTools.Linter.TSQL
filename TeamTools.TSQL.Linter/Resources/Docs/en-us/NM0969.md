# Service broker naming convention violation - valid URL expected

|||
|-|-|
| Id | **NM0969**
| Mnemo | SB_NAME_URL
| Severity | ℹ Hint
| Category | [Naming](./Category_Naming.md)
| Source code | [ServiceBrokerPublicNameAsUrlRule.cs](../../../Rules/Naming/ServiceBrokerPublicNameAsUrlRule.cs)

## Cause
The rule is triggered if the project settings specify
that the name of public Service Broker objects should match the URL/Path type,
but it does not match.

<p id="descr">Use URL/Path-like names.</p>

## Examples

Good

```sql
//my_domain/my_subject/my_folder/my_object_name
```

## Tips

💡 The rule applies only to public Service Broker objects:
* message types
* contracts
* services
	
💡 Requires such notation only in projects where it is explicitly specified in the settings.
