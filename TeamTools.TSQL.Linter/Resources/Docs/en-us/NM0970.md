# Service broker naming convention violation - PascalCase expected

|||
|-|-|
| Id | **NM0970**
| Mnemo | SB_NAME_PASCAL_CASE
| Severity | ℹ Hint
| Category | [Naming](./Category_Naming.md)
| Source code | [ServiceBrokerPublicNamePascalCaseRule.cs](../../../Rules/Naming/ServiceBrokerPublicNamePascalCaseRule.cs)

## Cause
The rule is triggered if the project settings specify
that the name of public Service Broker objects should match the PascalCase notation,
but it does not match.

<p id="descr">Use PascalCase notation.</p>

## Examples

Good

```sql
//MyDomain/MySubject/MyFolder/MyObjectName
```

## Tips

💡 The rule applies only to public Service Broker objects:
* message types
* contracts
* services
	
💡 Requires such notation only in projects where it is explicitly specified in the settings.
