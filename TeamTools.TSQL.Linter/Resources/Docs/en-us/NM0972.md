| Mnemo | VARIABLE_NAME_CAMEL_CASE
| Severity | ℹ Hint
| Category | [Naming](./Category_Naming.md)
| Source code | [VariableNameCamelCaseRule.cs](../../../Rules/Naming/VariableNameCamelCaseRule.cs)

## Cause
The rule is triggered if the project settings specify
that the variable name must match the camelCase notation,
but it does not match.

<p id="descr">Use camelCase notation.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
DECLARE @my_var NVARCHAR(50);
```

Good

```sql
DECLARE @myVar NVARCHAR(50);
```

## Tips

💡 Table variables follow the rules for tables.

💡 Requires such notation only in projects where it is explicitly specified in the settings.
