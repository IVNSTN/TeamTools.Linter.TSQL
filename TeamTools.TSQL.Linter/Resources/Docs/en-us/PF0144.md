| Severity | ⚠ Warning

| Source code | [NocountOptionInProcRule.cs](../../../Rules/Performance/NocountOptionInProcRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if the `NOCOUNT` option is not set in the stored procedure.
<p id="descr">Set the NOCOUNT option.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.foo
AS
BEGIN
    SET XACT_ABORT ON;

    SELECT 1 AS Alias;
```

Good

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.foo
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT, XACT_ABORT ON;

    SELECT 1 AS Alias;
```

## Tips

💡 Generally, the `ON` setting is required. However, if you need to use the `OFF` setting, you can apply it as needed—the rule does not validate the option's specific value.
