## Cause

<p id="descr">The NOCOUNT option should be set in every stored procedure.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.foo
AS
BEGIN
    SET XACT_ABORT ON;

    SELECT 1 AS Alias;
```

Good

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.foo
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT, XACT_ABORT ON;

    SELECT 1 AS Alias;
```

## Tips

💡 Generally, the ON setting is required. However, if you need to use the OFF setting, you can apply it as needed—the rule does not validate the option's specific value.
