| Id | **PF0145**
| Mnemo | TRIGGER_SET_NOCOUNT
| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [Performance](./Category_Performance.md), [Triggers](./Group_Triggers.md)
| Source code | [NocountOptionInTriggerRule.cs](../../../Rules/Performance/NocountOptionInTriggerRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if the `NOCOUNT` option is not set in the trigger.
<p id="descr">Set the NOCOUNT option.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER dbo.acc_types_u_after
ON dbo.acc_types
AFTER UPDATE
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT ...
```

Good

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER dbo.acc_types_u_after
ON dbo.acc_types
AFTER UPDATE
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;

    INSERT ...
```

## Tips

💡 Generally, the `ON` setting is required. However, if you need to use the `OFF` setting, you can apply it as needed - the rule does not validate the option's specific value.

💡 It is advisable to set the option only after verifying `@@ROWCOUNT`.
