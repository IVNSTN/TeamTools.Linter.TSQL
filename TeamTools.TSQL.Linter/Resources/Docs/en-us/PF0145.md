| Mnemo | TRIGGER_SET_NOCOUNT
| Severity | ⚠ Warning

| Source code | [NocountOptionInTriggerRule.cs](../../../Rules/Performance/NocountOptionInTriggerRule.cs)

## Cause

<p id="descr">The NOCOUNT option should be set in every trigger.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER dbo.acc_types_u_after
ON dbo.acc_types
AFTER UPDATE
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT ...
```

Good

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER dbo.acc_types_u_after
ON dbo.acc_types
AFTER UPDATE
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;
    
    INSERT ...
```

## Tips

💡 Generally, the ON setting is required. However, if you need to use the OFF setting, you can apply it as needed - the rule does not validate the option's specific value.

💡 It is advisable to set the option only after verifying @@ROWCOUNT.
