## Cause

This rule is triggered if there is a different literal in the datasets combined using `UNION`.
<p id="descr">Use UNION ALL.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
    SELECT
        EmployeeID,
        'Dept: 1st' AS Department
    FROM dbo.Employees1
    UNION
    SELECT
        EmployeeID,
        'Dept: 2nd' AS Department
    FROM dbo.Employees2;
```

Good

```sql
    SELECT
        EmployeeID,
        'Dept: 1st' AS Department
    FROM dbo.Employees1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
        EmployeeID,
        'Dept: 2nd' AS Department
    FROM dbo.Employees2;
```

## Tips

💡 `UNION` also removes duplicate rows from the result set (similar to the `DISTINCT` effect), so be cautious when changing it to `UNION ALL`.
