## Cause

<p id="descr">An index with a filter condition WHERE &lt;col&gt; IS NULL can only be utilized for queries with the same filter if the specified column is included in the index's INCLUDE list. Otherwise, the index will not be used</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE INDEX IXF_dbo_foo_id ON dbo.foo(id)
WHERE title IS NULL;
```

Good

```sql
CREATE INDEX IXF_dbo_foo_id ON dbo.foo(id)
WHERE title IS NOT NULL;

CREATE INDEX IXIF_dbo_foo_id ON dbo.foo(id)
INCLUDE(title) WHERE title IS NULL;
```
