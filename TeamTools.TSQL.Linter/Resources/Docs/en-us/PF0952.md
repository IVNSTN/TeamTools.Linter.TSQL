## Cause

<p id="descr">There is no need to sort the result set of views, as they are embedded in other queries where the final sorting will be applied. Sorting within views is either redundant or may lead to an unreliable solution.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE VIEW dbo.my_view
AS
    SELECT TOP (100) PERCENT
           id
           , title
    FROM dbo.foo
    ORDER BY id;
```

Good

```sql
CREATE VIEW dbo.my_view
AS
    SELECT
           id
           , title
    FROM dbo.foo;
```

## Tips

💡 In application interfaces, users often have the ability to adjust sorting preferences, making sorting within database views unnecessary. Even when sorting cannot be modified by users, it is more effective to manage a fixed sort order at the application level. Shifting this logic and responsibility to the database is not a recommended practice. Sorting should be handled by the application itself.
