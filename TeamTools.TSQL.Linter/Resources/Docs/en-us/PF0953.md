| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [Performance](./Category_Performance.md)
| Source code | [TopTakesAllRule.cs](../../../Rules/Performance/TopTakesAllRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if the `TOP` clause constraint specifies `100 PERCENT` or a large number of rows.
<p id="descr">Delete the TOP clause.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
SELECT TOP (100) PERCENT
    a, b, c
FROM dbo.bar
```

Good

```sql
SELECT a, b, c
FROM dbo.bar
```

## Tips

💡 There is no need to sort the result set of views. This is additionally enforced by rule [PF0952](./PF0952.md).

💡 To concatenate strings in a specific order, it is recommended to use the `STRING_AGG` function, which allows you to specify sorting.

💡 For numbering rows in a specific order, it is advisable to use the `ROWNUMBER` function, where sorting can be defined.

💡 Utility and administrative stored procedures for handling batch data transfers should be organized within dedicated schemas.
