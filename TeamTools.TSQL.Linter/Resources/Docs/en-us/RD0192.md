| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [Redundancy](./Category_Redundancy.md)
| Source code | [ExistsOutputControlRule.cs](../../../Rules/Redundancy/ExistsOutputControlRule.cs)

## Cause

<p id="descr">When processing EXISTS, DB Egine completely ignores the SELECT part, so no columns or TOP are needed. It will not be able to return the list either, so ORDER BY, GROUP BY (without HAVING), OFFSET are not needed either.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
IF EXISTS (SELECT TOP(10) id FROM dbo.employee ORDER BY salary)...
```

Good

```sql
IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM dbo.employee)...
```
