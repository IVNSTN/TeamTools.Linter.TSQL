| Severity | ℹ Hint
| Category | [Redundancy](./Category_Redundancy.md)
| Source code | [RedundantHavingUsageRule.cs](../../../Rules/Redundancy/RedundantHavingUsageRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if the `HAVING` expression uses a column that is already present in `GROUP BY`.
<p id="descr">Move the predicate from HAVING to WHERE.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
SELECT salary, COUNT(1) as cnt
FROM dbo.employee
GROUP BY salary
HAVING salary >= 100
```

Good

```sql
SELECT salary, COUNT(1) as cnt
FROM dbo.employee
WHERE salary >= 100
GROUP BY salary
```
