## Cause

<p id="descr">According to the aggregated column (listed in GROUP BY), it is pointless to do HAVING - move the predicate to WHERE.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
SELECT salary, COUNT(1) as cnt
FROM dbo.employee
GROUP BY salary
HAVING salary >= 100
```

Good

```sql
SELECT salary, COUNT(1) as cnt
FROM dbo.employee
WHERE salary >= 100
GROUP BY salary
```
