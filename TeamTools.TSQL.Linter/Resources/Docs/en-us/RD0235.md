## Cause

<p id="descr">You don't need a space after the parenthesis before the first literal or expression, just like you don't need a space right before the closing parenthesis.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
IF EXISTS (   SELECT 1 FROM dbo.accounts    )...
```

Good

```sql
IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM dbo.accounts)...
```

## Tips

💡 Make sure that you have applied the formatter and it is configured correctly

💡 Multiline brackets designed as BEGIN-END are ignored - there are always a lot of spaces before ). But after ( you still don't need a space.
