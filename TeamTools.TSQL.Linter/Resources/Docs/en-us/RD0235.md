| Source code | [RedundantSpaceWithinParenthesisRule.cs](../../../Rules/Redundancy/RedundantSpaceWithinParenthesisRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if there is a space character after the opening `(` or before the closing parenthesis `)`.
<p id="descr">Remove spaces after the opening and before the closing parentheses.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
IF EXISTS (   SELECT 1 FROM dbo.accounts    )...
```

Good

```sql
IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM dbo.accounts)...
```

## Tips

💡 Make sure that you have applied the formatter and it is configured correctly.

💡 Multiline brackets placed like `BEGIN-END` are ignored - there are always a lot of spaces before `)`. But after `(` you still don't need a space.
