| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [Redundancy](./Category_Redundancy.md)
| Source code | [RedundantSelectScalarRule.cs](../../../Rules/Redundancy/RedundantSelectScalarRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if scalar variables or literal values are wrapped in `SELECT` unnecessarily.
<p id="descr">Rewrite it without using SELECT for scalar values.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
INSERT dbo.foo (title)
SELECT @title
WHERE @title IS NOT NULL
```

Good

```sql
IF @title IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
    INSERT dbo.foo(title)
    VALUES (@title)
END
```

## Tips

💡 The rule does not apply to constructions like `ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)`. Although this is not the most desirable construction in T-SQL.

💡 The rule also does not apply to `CROSS`/`OUTER APPLY`, in which the formulas are applied in order to comply with the DRY principle.
