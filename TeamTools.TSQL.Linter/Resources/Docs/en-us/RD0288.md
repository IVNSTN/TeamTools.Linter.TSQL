## Cause

<p id="descr">There is absolutely no need to wrap scalar variables and literals in (SELECT ...).</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
INSERT dbo.foo (title)
SELECT @title
WHERE @title IS NOT NULL
```

Good

```sql
IF @title IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
    INSERT dbo.foo(title)
    VALUES (@title)
END
```

## Tips

💡 The rule does not react at constuctions like ORDER BY (SELECT NULL). Although this is not the most desirable construction in T-SQL.

💡 The rule also does not react to CROSS/OUTER APPLY, in which formulas are applied to comply with DRY.
