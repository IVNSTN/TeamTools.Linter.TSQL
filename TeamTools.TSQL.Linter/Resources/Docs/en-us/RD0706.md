| Severity | ⚠ Warning

| Source code | [RedundantTypeConversionRule.cs](../../../Rules/Redundancy/RedundantTypeConversionRule.cs)

## Cause

This rule is triggered if the variable is explicitly converted to the same data type as it was originally declared.
<p id="descr">Remove redundant type conversion.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
DECLARE @b VARCHAR(1) = 'B'

PRINT CAST('A' + @b AS VARCHAR(2))
```

Good

```sql
DECLARE @b VARCHAR(1) = 'B'

PRINT 'A' + @b
```

## Tips

💡 The rule ignores literals, since an explicit indication of what type, for example, a calculated column in a query should have is rather a good style.
