## Cause

This rule is triggered if the CONTINUE command is found at the end of the WHILE loop body.
<p id="descr">Remove the CONTINUE command.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    PRINT @a
    FETCH NEXT FROM cr INTO @a
    CONTINUE
END

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    PRINT @a
    FETCH NEXT FROM cr INTO @a
    IF @a > 10
    BEGIN
        CONTINUE
    END;
END
```

Good

```sql
WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    PRINT @a
    IF @a > 10
        BREAK
    FETCH NEXT FROM cr INTO @a
END

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    PRINT @a
    IF @a > 10
        CONTINUE
    FETCH NEXT FROM cr INTO @a
END
```
