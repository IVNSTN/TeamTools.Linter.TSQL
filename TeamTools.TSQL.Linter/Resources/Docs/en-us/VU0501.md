| Mnemo | DATABASE_ALTERING
| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [Vulnerability](./Category_Vulnerability.md)
| Source code | [DatabaseAlteringRule.cs](../../../Rules/Vulnerability/DatabaseAlteringRule.cs)

## Cause

The rule is triggered when code contains CREATE, ALTER or DROP DATABASE commands.
<p id="descr">Remove DDL commands for database manipulations.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE DATABASE test;

DROP DATABASE old;
```

## Tips

💡 Choose dedicated schemas and databases for internal and system procedures.

💡 With access to service procedures an ordinary user of the product can directly or indirectly gain access to the management of the DBMS, which is unsafe. Only DBAs can have this level of access.
