| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [Vulnerability](./Category_Vulnerability.md)
| Source code | [DatabaseOptionSwitchRule.cs](../../../Rules/Vulnerability/DatabaseOptionSwitchRule.cs)

## Cause

The rule is triggered when code contains commands for changing database options.
<p id="descr">Avoid using code which change database options.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
ALTER DATABASE mydb SET RECOVERY FULL;

SET TEXTSIZE 12;

EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', '1';
```

## Tips

💡 Choose dedicated schemas and databases for internal and system procedures.

💡 With access to service procedures an ordinary user of the product can directly or indirectly gain access to the management of the DBMS, which is unsafe. Only DBAs can have this level of access.
