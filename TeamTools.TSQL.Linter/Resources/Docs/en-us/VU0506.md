<p id="descr">Remove extended stored procedures.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
EXEC xp_some_procedure;
```

## Tips

💡 Choose dedicated schemas and databases for internal and system procedures.

💡 With access to service procedures an ordinary user of the product can directly or indirectly gain access to the management of the DBMS, which is unsafe. Only DBAs can have this level of access.
