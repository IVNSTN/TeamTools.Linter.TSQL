| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [Vulnerability](./Category_Vulnerability.md)
| Source code | [SystemProcedureCallRule.cs](../../../Rules/Vulnerability/SystemProcedureCallRule.cs)

## Cause

The rule is triggered when code runs system stored procedures.
<p id="descr">Remove system stored procedure.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
EXEC sp_who2;
```

## Tips

💡 Choose dedicated schemas and databases for internal and system procedures.

💡 With access to service procedures an ordinary user of the product can directly or indirectly gain access to the management of the DBMS, which is unsafe. Only DBAs can have this level of access.

💡 sp_executesql is ignored here and handled by rule [VU0509](./VU0509.md).

💡 sp_getapplock, sp_releaseapplock are ignored here and handled by rule [CS0520](./CS0520.md).
