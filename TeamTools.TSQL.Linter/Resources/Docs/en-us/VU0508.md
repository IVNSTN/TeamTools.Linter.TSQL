## Cause

The rule is triggered when code contains DBCC commands.
<p id="descr">Remove DBCC command.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
DBCC SHOW_STATISTICS ("dbo.table", PK_column);
```

## Tips

💡 Choose dedicated schemas and databases for internal and system procedures.

💡 With access to service procedures an ordinary user of the product can directly or indirectly gain access to the management of the DBMS, which is unsafe. Only DBAs can have this level of access.
