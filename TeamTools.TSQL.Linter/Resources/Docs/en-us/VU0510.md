The rule is triggered when code contains SQLDMO procedure calls.
<p id="descr">Remove SQLDMO command.</p>

## Examples

```sql
EXEC sp_OACreate;

## Tips

💡 Choose dedicated schemas and databases for internal and system procedures.

💡 With access to service procedures an ordinary user of the product can directly or indirectly gain access to the management of the DBMS, which is unsafe. Only DBAs can have this level of access.

💡 Move the ETL code to SSIS.
