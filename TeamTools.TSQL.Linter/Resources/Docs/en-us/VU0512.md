| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [Vulnerability](./Category_Vulnerability.md)
| Source code | [PrivilegeManagementInCodeRule.cs](../../../Rules/Vulnerability/PrivilegeManagementInCodeRule.cs)

## Cause

The rule is triggered when code contains commands for privilege managing.
<p id="descr">Remove commands for privilege managing.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
CREATE ROLE test_role;

ALTER ROLE test_role ADD MEMBER usr;

GRANT EXEC on dbo.test TO usr;
```

## Tips

💡 Choose dedicated schemas and databases for internal and system procedures.

💡 With access to service procedures an ordinary user of the product can directly or indirectly gain access to the management of the DBMS, which is unsafe. Only DBAs can have this level of access.

💡 Special tables should be used to control access. These tables ought to be designed to describe permissions and restrictions to system components (not DBMS objects)
