|||
|-|-|
| Id | **VU0519**
| Mnemo | SYS_DYNAMIC_VIEW
| Severity | ⚠ Warning
| Category | [Vulnerability](./Category_Vulnerability.md)
| Source code | [DynamicViewsRule.cs](../../../Rules/Vulnerability/DynamicViewsRule.cs)

## Cause

The rule is triggered when code contains system dynamic views.
<p id="descr">Rewrite the code without using system dynamic views.</p>

## Examples

Bad

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_exec_query_stats;
```

## Tips

💡 Choose dedicated schemas and databases for internal and system procedures.

💡 With access to service procedures an ordinary user of the product can directly or indirectly gain access to the management of the DBMS, which is unsafe. Only DBAs can have this level of access.

💡 In most cases system dynamic views require extended privileges.

💡 The HOST_NAME() function should be sufficient for logging purposes. There is no need to extract IP address.
